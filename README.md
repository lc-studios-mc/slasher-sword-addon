## :information_source: About

_Slasher_ is a cool melee weapon that is a part of [another addon by me](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia).

**It's compatible with other addons that use player.json, such as gun addons!**

One day, I was asked to create a learning material for people who want to make cool animated melee weapons with complex mechanics without using player.json.

So I decided to do it with the Slasher!

<details>
<summary>Lore</summary>

It is a medium-sized chainsaw-like sword,
originally developed for an organization dedicated to containing anomalous entities.

In recent years, it has undergone testing and proven its usefulness.

It is currently in limited use by special forces around the world.
